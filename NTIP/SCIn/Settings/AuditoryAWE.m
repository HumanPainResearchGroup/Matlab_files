%% NOTES ON SETTINGS:
% 1/h.Settings.df*0.25 AND (1/df+1/pitchdiff)*0.25 needs to be a multiple of 1/f0 to prevent clicking caused by phase re-setting of the f0 sound
% Settings that work:
% df=10Hz: f0=200, pitchdiff=200 
% df=25Hz: f0=200, pitchdiff=200 
% df=40Hz: f0=160, pitchdiff=160
%strategy: decide on df first, then pitchdiff (ideally a multiple of df),
%then calculate:
% 1./((1/h.Settings.df+1/pitchdiff)*0.25 ./ [1:10])
% and choose a frequency for f0.
% seems to work if f0 and pitchdiff are both multiples of df, and f0 and
% pitchdiff are also multiples of each other?
